Objective 3: ALGORITHM\

Task 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).\

If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.\


1.Ask the user to enter N\
2.Ask the user to enter n\
3.Calculate the value of n MOD N\
4.Calculate the value of N MOD 2\
5.If value of n MOD N is 0 then N is a divisor otherwise not\
6.If value of N MOD 2 is 0 then N is even otherwise odd\
7.Display whether N is a divisor\
8.Display whether N is even or odd\
